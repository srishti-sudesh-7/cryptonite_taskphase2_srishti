Procedure:
- first, I went to the website they linked and this is what it looked like: ![Screenshot 2024-11-07 112250](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa52a89f-488d-4997-8c2c-0e566752a0e6)
- I entered snickerdoodle first, since it was given as an example and got this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc8c729b-771a-4f2f-bf93-c41a858e9edc)
- since the challenge is called, I entered developer mode on chrome (Ctrl+Shift+i) to inspect the cookies.
- there was only one cookie called name, whose value changed with each entry given by the user. for example, when I entered snickerdoodle, it went from -1 to 0:

- I kept changing the cookie value and refreshed the page and found that I got different names of cookies:

- eventually, value 18 gave me the flag:

# Forbidden Paths

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313c40fa-2714-4963-96da-2162ce4e8d2b)
- I already knew that the website's location was /usr/share/nginx/html therefore that would make the flag's location at /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt.
- however since the website wouldnt take any absolute paths as mentioned in the description, I figured I'd need to use relative paths
- from TP-1, I'd already learnt the use of . and .. through pwn colleg, so I just applied it here
- the parent directories can be replaced by .. and the current one by .
- therefore relative path is `../../../../flag.txt`
